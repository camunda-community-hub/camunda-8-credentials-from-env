Deterministically extract [Camunda 8 Client credentials](https://docs.camunda.io/docs/guides/setup-client-connection-credentials/#set-up-client-connection-credentials) from the environment in Node.js. Uses [neon-env](https://www.npmjs.com/package/neon-env) under the hood.

To install in your project:

```
npm i camunda-8-credentials-from-env
```

To use: 

```typescript
import * as c from "camunda-8-credentials-from-env"

// throws if required credential elements are not found in the environment
const operateCreds = c.getOperateCredentials()
const optimizeCreds = c.getOptimiseCredentials()
const tasklistCreds = c.getTasklistCredentials()
const zeebeCreds = c.getZeebeCredentials()
```

The library will only hit the environment once. Further calls to the same method will return a cached set of values.
